	<h2>
		Does it matter what order your if-statements are in?
	</h2>
	<p>
		If 25 is after 21 and user is 26, the log for userAge >= 21 will post before the log for userAge >= 25. Order does matter. If variables store the returns then controlling the order of console logs.
	</p>
	
	<h2>
		When testing ranges, did you use &&, ||, or something else entirely (e.g. nested if-statements)? If you used &&, why is that a better choice than || (and vice-versa)?
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		I found that nested if statements helped the most - offered the most control. && is more accurate than ||
	</p>
	
	<h2>
		What types of input produce a value of NaN after parsing? Is it important to check for NaN values? Is it possible for a NaN value to trigger any of the other if-statements? If so, how and why?
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		Parsing input that isn't a number (strings or other data-types) will return the value NaN. <br>
		Programs can break if you don't check for NaN values when comparing integer/floats. <br>
		typeof NaN is a number - so it could trigger other if-statements if those comparisons are numbers.
