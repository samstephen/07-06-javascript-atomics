<h1>JS Atomic 06C</h1>

<h2>If you collect the user's input as a string (i.e. without using parseInt() to turn it into an integer), does == work to compare the input to the stored secret number? Would === work? Which is best?</h2>
<p>Yes "==" works but "===" would work better because it is being more exact.</p>

<h2>If you collect the user's input as an integer (i.e. by using parseInt() to turn it into an integer), can you use == to compare? ===? Which is better in this case?</h2>
<p>In this case "==" works just as well as "===" because they are both integers.</p>

<h2>What is the difference between == and ===?</h2>
<p>"==" compares values while "===" compares values and data types.</p>

<h2>In this case, does it make more sense to leave the user's guess as a string, or to convert it to an integer? Why? What are the relative advantages / disadvantages of each approach (particularly in terms of the types of new features that might be able to be added)?</h2>
<p>It makes more sense to be explicit when comparing values and data types to be as efficient as possible. Some disadvantages to this are that you have to write extra code to get the same job done and the computer has manipulate extra data.</p>
