<h1>What do you call true and false values?</h1>
<p>booleans</p>
<h1>How is true similar or dissimilar from "true"? Can they be used in the same way?</h1>
<p>The boolean true has a value of truthy where as the string "true" does not have a value of truthy.</p>

<h1>Does it matter if the user-provided password matches your password exactly, or is there some flexibility allowed in capitalization?</h1>
<p>Yes, the capitalization of the word does matter.</p>

<h1>Did you use = or == or === to compare passwords (or something else)? Why? Would any of the others work?</h1>
<p>I used the === to compare passwords, == would probably work too since there is no need for the data type to be the same.</p>

<h1>Why is it a bad idea to store a password (or other sensitive information) in plain text in a Javascript file?</h1>
<p>Because anyone can inspect element and get into sensitive materials.</p>
