<h1>JS Atomic 6F: Triangles</h1>

<h1>What do you call true and false values?</h1>
<p>booleans</p>
<h1>What happens if one (or more) of the lengths aren't input correctly and thus end up as NaN?</h1>
<p></p>

<h1>What happens if one of the lengths of the triangle is 0? Two of the lengths? All three lengths?</h1>
<p></p>

<h1>What happens if the user inputs one or more negative integers for the lengths of the triangle's legs?</h1>
<p></p>

<h1>Assuming errors exist, note that all of these errors come from the user inputting one or more invalid values. What are some strategies you might use to prevent this from happening (or at least to prevent those invalid values from being used).</h1>
