<h1>JS Atomic 6F: Triangles</h1>

<h1>What happens if one (or more) of the lengths aren't input correctly and thus end up as NaN?</h1>
<p>This is not a valid triangle. After change - any leg with value NaN will alert Invalid Input.</p>

<h1>What happens if one of the lengths of the triangle is 0? Two of the lengths? All three lengths?</h1>
<p> if firstLeg and secondLeg are 0 and thirdLeg is 1, the triangle is valid - this is because our program says if the sum of two sides are less than the third, the triangle is valid.</p>
<p>After change any side = to 0 will be Invalid Input</p>

<h1>What happens if the user inputs one or more negative integers for the lengths of the triangle's legs?</h1>
<p>will always be valid, after change any input with negatives will result in Invalid Input</p>

<h1>Assuming errors exist, note that all of these errors come from the user inputting one or more invalid values. What are some strategies you might use to prevent this from happening (or at least to prevent those invalid values from being used).</h1>
<p>using conditional statements to return invalid value responses</p>
