<h1>JS Atomic 6E: Driver's Ed, Part 2</h1>


<h2>Does it matter what order your if / else if statements happen? If you reorder them, does your program still produce correct output?</h2>
<p>
	no. only one of the statements will run depending on the value and comparison. if reordered it will produce correct output
</p>

<h2>What's wrong with this conditional: if (age < 16 && age > 21)?</h2>
<p>
	Age cannot be less than 16 and greater than 21 at the same time
</p>

<h2>Let's say that your program needs to be easy to modify so that it works in parts of the country/world where the age ranges are different. How would you replace the numbers in your if statements with variables to make the program make sense? Or is it easier to just have the numbers be there? Does it matter?</h2>
<p>
	yes, based on country the variables' values for age ranges should change.
</p>

<h2>What questions do you have?</h2>

<p>none</p>
