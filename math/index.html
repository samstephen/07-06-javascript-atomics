<h1>
    What happens when you try to parse the integer out of a string like "Error 404"? How about "404 Error"? Other combinations of numbers and letters? What needs to be true about the incoming string for it to be parsed correctly?
</h1>
<p>
    "Error 404" would return NaN, "404 Error" would return 404.
</p>
<p>
    If the beginning of a string isn't a number the result will be NaN.
</p>


<h1>
    What happens if one (or more) of the inputs are non-numeric text (like a comma or a dollar-sign)? What errors occur, if any? What does the console output tell you?
</h1>
<p>
    The variable will return "NaN" but it's data-type is a "number".
</p>


<h1>
    Why might you use the increment (++) or decrement (--) operators? What are some applications that you predict might come into play?
    What questions do you have?
</h1>
<p>
    while loops to count how many times something is done. no questions.
