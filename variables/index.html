<h1>JS Atomic 03</h1>
<!-- Answer the 5 questions above here -->

<h1>Given what you know so far, what are some reasons to use variables?</h1>
<p>To display data and manipulate it dynamically.</p>

<h1>What are some advantages to variable names like hairColor instead of hc (for example)? What are some disadvantages?</h1>
<p>Clarity for yourself and your peers. hc would be quicker to write</p>

<h1>Given what you know so far, what can you predict about other ways we might use variables?</h1>
<p>manipulate data dynamically</p>

<h1>Why don't you need to use the var keyword every time you use a variable (right now, we only use it when we create the variable)? What does var do?</h1>
<p>var keyword initializes the variable defined - after it is defined there is no use for "var" for that variable.</p>

<h1>What happens if you try to do output with a variable without first assigning a value to that variable? What happens? Does the program still work as intended? Do error messages show up in the console? If so, what error message?</h1>
<p>variables that are not assigned a value will be "undefined". The program works - but there are not any "error messages". the variable will just show undefined because nothing was returned.</p>

<h1>What questions do you have?</h1>
<p>none</p>
