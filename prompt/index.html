<h1>What happens if the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent) without typing anything in? What information gets assigned to a variable, if any?</h1>
<p>An empty string is assigned to the variable if user clicks OK without input. Clicking cancel will show var is null and the data-type for that variable is an object.</p>

<h1>How did you choose your variable names? If you gave a list of variable names to someone who hasn't seen your code, could they reasonably predict what information you might store in each?</h1>
<p>I try to make my var names be as simplistic and descriptive as possible. yes.</p>

<h1>If you completely changed a question you were asking the user, would it make sense to totally rename the variable? What if you changed the order of your questions?</h1>
<p>changing the question would prompt you to change the variable - if you were looking for different input.</p>
<p>If you changed the order of questions, a variable would not need to be redefined.</p>

<h1>
    In these exercises, we use prompt() to collect information, but most websites do that ask for information do not use prompt() -- how do they collect information (what HTML elements do they use)? What might be an advantage to doing it that way instead of with prompt()? Are there any disadvantages? Why might you use prompt()?
</h1>
<p>
    Most sites would use form tags (<code>&lt;form&gt;</code>) to collect info.
</p>
<p>
    A large disadvantage for using prompt over forms would be the user disabling js from using prompts to get input.
</p>

<h1>
    Research prompt() -- is there any way to make it so that there are two (or more) fields?
</h1>
<p>
    It is not possible. There is no way to assign multiple distinct values to a single variable.
</p>

<h1>
    What questions do you have?
</h1>
<p>
    none.
