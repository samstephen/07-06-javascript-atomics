<h1>JS Atomic 02</h1>

<h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
<p>"alert" displays a popup for user, "console.log" will write to a browser's console.</p>

<h2>What's one situation where you might use an `alert()` to tell the user something?</h2>
<p>If user is trying to leave page but needs to save.</p>

<h2>What's one way that `alert()` might get obnoxious?</h2>
<p>Asking if user wants to leave for no reason.</p>

<h2>Would it make sense to use console.log() to tell the user things? Why or why not?</h2>
<p>No because most users wouldn't look at their browsers console.</p>

<h2>What's one way that console.log() might be a good tool for you to use?</h2>
<p>Debugging.</p>

<h2>When do the console.log() statements get run? Is it before the first alert() gets displayed? After it gets displayed but before the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent)? After the user clicks to close the dialog box? A different time? How did you find out for sure?</h2>
<p>When the event occurs - everything is run by chronological order of the way the script was written.</p>
<p>The log will occur after the user clicks OK.</p>


<h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
<p>none</p>
